Designing YouTube for People Like Me
This wasn’t just a design challenge.
It was personal.

I’ve lost countless hours to the black hole of impulsive scrolling on YouTube. One video becomes two, then five, then “how is it 3am?” And no matter how good the content is, that drained, twitchy feeling after... it stuck with me.

So when I read the problem statement, I didn’t just see a task —
I saw my own behavior. And I knew no one could design a better solution than someone who’s been in that loop again and again.

🌿 Solution 1: Mindful Break with Taste Tuning
Instead of guilt-tripping users with time warnings, I asked:

What if a break could be inviting?

So I built a safe, ambient space users can choose to enter — a calm, glowy pause moment that says:

“Breathe.”

“What’s your vibe right now?”

“Let’s tune your feed around that.”

It’s a break... with benefits.

The “Taste Tuning” cards let users quickly express their mood (lo-fi? curious? silly?) — and that input shapes their next set of recommendations.
A small emotional check-in = a better feed.

🔥 Solution 2: FlowState – Time-Aware Glow UI
Instead of disruptive alerts, I created a color-shifting interface that changes as you lose track of time.

15 mins in → a subtle warm orange

30 mins → vibrant peach tones

45+ mins → rich crimson dusk glow

You don’t need to think about it.
You feel it.
It’s like your screen’s gently reminding you:

“Hey, time’s passing. Are you still in the flow—or just... stuck?”

This is UX that nudges you — softly, subconsciously — without a single pop-up.

📖 What Inspired Me
Reading The Design of Everyday Things taught me that the best designs don’t shout—they whisper. They work with human behavior, not against it.

So I focused on:

Affordances that feel natural (like glowy time cues)

Emotion-first interfaces (breaks that feel like little rituals)

Minimal choices that give maximum self-awareness

Figma plugins inspiration for motion and glow effects

Color psychology for engagement without overstimulation

🧩 Why This Isn’t Just a Concept
This is real. This is me designing for myself, and for millions of others like me.
People who love YouTube, but hate that feeling after an unplanned 90-minute spiral.

I didn’t want to fight the dopamine.
I wanted to guide it gently.

🙌 Final Note
If I get the chance to intern with YouTube India, I won’t just be another designer.
I’ll be someone who understands the edge cases, the real moments, the invisible habits—
and can design for them with empathy, intuition, and just enough sparkle ✨
